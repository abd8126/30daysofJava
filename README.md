## Getting Started :
    Ques1: You've to check whether a given number is prime or not.
           Take a number "t" as input representing count of input numbers to be tested.
           Take a number "n" as input "t" number of times.
           For each input value of n, print "prime" if the number is prime and "not prime" otherwise.
      
    Ques2: You are required to print a 'z' of size 5 using '*'.

    Ques3: 1. You are given as input marks of a student.
           2. Display an appropriate message based on the following rules:
               2.1 for marks above 90, print excellent.
               2.2 for marks above 80 and less than equal to 90, print good.
               2.3 for marks above 70 and less than equal to 80, print fair.
               2.4 for marks above 60 and less than equal to 70, print meets expectations.
               2.5 for marks less than equal to 60, print below par.

           2. Take as input three numbers a, b and c.
           3. Print true if they can form a pythagorean triplet and false otherwise.
    Ques5: 1. You've to print all prime numbers between a range. 
           2. Take as input "low", the lower limit of range.
           3. Take as input "high", the higher limit of range.
           4. For the range print all the primes numbers between low and high (both included).

    Ques6: 1. You've to print first n fibonacci numbers.
           2. Take as input "n", the count of fibonacci numbers to print.
           3. Print first n fibonacci numbers.
